# exciting-plus-gpu
A modified version of the Exciting Plus FP-LAPW electronic structure and linear response code.

This is the version of Exciting-Plus developed by Wileam Phan, building on top of these versions:
- http://elk.sourceforge.net/ (Elk version 1.0.17)
- https://github.com/toxa81/exciting-plus (Exciting-Plus)
- https://github.com/rgvanwesep/exciting-plus-rgvw-mod
- https://github.com/shedsaw/exciting-plus-rgvw-mod (`cuda-titan` branch)

*This particular branch* `cuda-hydra` *is used for development on Wil's laptop, Wil's* NVIDIA *Jetson Nano developer kit, the Hydra cluster* (EECS UTK), *and the Beacon cluster* (ACF UTK / NICS). *Commits with useful stuff or enhancements will be cherry-picked back and forth between this branch and* `openacc-summit`.

See [readme-shedsaw](readme-shedsaw) and [README.elk](README.elk) for the original readme files.
