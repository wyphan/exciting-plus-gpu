Here is the source code for generating the "lps" input. The input for genlps is in the genlps.in file. It has the maximum "l" quantum number you want as the first line and a 3x3 matrix that has vectors representing the x', y' and z' axes as the 1st, 2nd and 3rd columns, respectively. The output is in LPS.OUT and it has matrices that are ready to be copy-pasted into the "lps" input block.
